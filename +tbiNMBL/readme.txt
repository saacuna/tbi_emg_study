Update: this tbiNMBL class has been replaced by the tbiStudy functions. Much easier to implement, since it uses a SQLite database.

this package contains all the classes and functions necessary for processing subjects in the
TCNL TBI study. 

I was going to implement a more robus tbiNmbl.tbiNMBL class, but didnt get to it.
So, its easiest just to create a bunch of tbiNMBL.subject_tbiNMBL classes to look at data, since we are not really interested in comparing of TBI subjects, except to healthy ones
